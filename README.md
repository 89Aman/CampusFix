# CampusFix
A smart campus issue reporting app
It's designed to solve the real headache of broken facilities, dirty washrooms, and maintenance delays that plague every Indian college.

Core Problem It Solves
Students deal with leaky taps, broken fans, no drinking water, or dark staircases daily, but complaints get lost in WhatsApp groups or ignored suggestion boxes. CampusFix makes reporting instant, trackable, and prioritized so admin actually fixes things.
