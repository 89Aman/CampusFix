A smart campus issue reporting app designed to tackle the everyday frustrations of broken facilities, unclean washrooms, and maintenance delays that affect colleges across India.

## The Problem

Every day, students encounter issues like leaky taps, broken fans, unavailable drinking water, or poorly lit staircases. Traditional methods of reporting these problems, such as WhatsApp groups or suggestion boxes, often lead to complaints being lost or ignored.

## Our Solution

CampusFix provides a streamlined platform that makes reporting campus issues instant, trackable, and prioritized. This ensures that administrators can respond effectively and that problems actually get fixed.

## Key Features

- **Instant Reporting**: Quickly submit issues with descriptions and photos
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor the status of your reported issues
- **Priority Management**: Critical issues are highlighted for faster resolution
- **Transparent Process**: Both students and administrators stay informed throughout the resolution process

## Why CampusFix?

- Eliminates the chaos of scattered complaints across multiple channels
- Creates accountability for facility management
- Improves the overall campus experience for students and staff
- Provides data insights to help institutions identify recurring problems
